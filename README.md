# Blockchain Lottery 

This is a simple dApp centred around a lottery game, built using Solidity, React and the Truffle Suite. Through this project, it aims to appreciate the following: 

1. Blockchain promotes fairness of the games with its transparency since every piece of information is stored on the blocks 
2. The game is now easily accessible and available to anyone with a Metamask account, reducing barriers to entry for players to participate. 
3. Enhances trust in the system with the distribution of funds since every nods has a copy of hte ledger and reduces fraud. 
4. This promotes democracy and freedom from governemnetal / centralised control, eliminating the prevlaent concern of privacy today. 




## Whats the game about? 

Similar to a lottery game, players will bet on a number with their ether. A random number will be chosen by the system and the winner will be rewarded with the prize money proportionate to the amount they betted on.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
