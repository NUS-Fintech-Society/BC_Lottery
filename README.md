# Blo-ttery

This is a simple dApp centred around a lottery game, built using Solidity, React and the Truffle Suite. Through this project, it aims to appreciate the following: 

1. Blockchain promotes fairness of the games with its transparency since every piece of information is stored on the blocks 
2. The game is now easily accessible and available to anyone with a Metamask account, reducing barriers to entry for players to participate. 



## Whats the game about? 

Similar to a lottery game, players will bet on a number with their ether. A random number will be chosen by the system and the winner will be rewarded with the prize money proportionate to the amount they betted on. 

These are stored in ethereum's rinkeby test network, ensuring immutability. 

## Running the programme 

1. Install the relevant dependencies by running npm nstall 
2. Run npm start to deploy the project locally 
3. Change to the Rinkeby test network to interact with the project.
