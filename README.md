# Blockchain Lottery 

This is a simple dApp centred around a lottery game, built using Solidity, React and the Truffle Suite. Through this project, it aims to appreciate the following: 

1. Blockchain promotes fairness of the games with its transparency since every piece of information is stored on the blocks 
2. The game is now easily accessible and available to anyone with a Metamask account, reducing barriers to entry for playersto participate. 
3. Enhances trust in the system with the distribution of funds since every nods has a copy of hte ledger and reduces fraud. 
4. This promotes democracy and freedom from governemnetal / centralised control, eliminating the prevlaent concern of privacy today. 




## Whats the game about? 

Similar to a lottery game, players will bet on a number with their ether. A random number will be chosen by the system and the winner will be rewarded with the prize money proportionate to the amount they betted on.
